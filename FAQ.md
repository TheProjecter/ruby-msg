**Why do I have these 'L' and 'J' characters appearing in messages?**

You may need the wingdings font. These are smilies in the windgings font. I think it is only if word is used as the email editor. I put `wingdings.ttf` in `~/.fonts`, re-ran `fc-cache`, restarted thunderbird, and they displayed as smilies. Didn't work for evolution though?
